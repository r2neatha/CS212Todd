            <h1> Selecting a Font in HTML</h1>
            <p> I selected the font Times New Roman for my example, research for this action was relatively simple.
                Firstly, I consulted the book because I remember this example in chapter 10. On page 235 there is 
                and example using an external CSS style selector. I mimicked this into my own code with a different
                font.

            <h2> Creating my Own Font</h2>
            <p> Research for downloading my own custom font took a little more work compared to choosing a common 
                font. The resource that proved most helpful was a Youtube video by MainlyWebStuff titled 
                "Downloading fonts and using them in your design with CSS" I used this video along with my prior 
                knowledge of CSS to download my nordic font.</p>
