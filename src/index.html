    <h2>Addendum</h2>

    <p>Coding this project was one of my hardest challenges in HTML. I had to deal with many bugs that required a large amount of time and effort to fix. My process for this project began on my iPad where I used a bubble graph to map out my story. However, as I progressed with the coding journey the story evolved.</p>
    <p>Creating my HTML document was relatively simple, I had a little bit of prior knowledge working with divs. After I had a proper format I moved onto my javascript file. This was much more challenging as I was unsure how to properly format my choices. I can into many errors when creating my buttons and getting them to progress you to the next page. After some online research, I was able to find the proper format and only had to worry about the story.</p>
    <p>Overall this project helped me broaden my Javascript knowledge and allowed me to understand how buttons and selections are made within an HTML document.</p>
