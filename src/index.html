            <h2> Selecting a Font in HTML:</h2> 

            <p class="one"> I selected the font Times New Roman for my example, research for this action was relitivly simple.
                Firstly, I consulted the book becasue I remeber this example in chaper 10. On page 235 there is 
                and example using a external CSS style selector. I mimiced this into my own code with a different
                font.</p>

            <h3> Creating my Own Font:</h3>

            <p class="two"> Research for downloaidng my own custom font took a little more work compared to choosing a common 
                font. The resource that proved most helpful was a Youtube video by MainlyWebStuff titled 
                "Downloading fonts and using them in your design with CSS" I used this video along with my prior 
                knowledge of CSS to download my nordic font.</p>

            <h4>Addendum:</h4>

            <p class="three"> For the CSS style choices in my website I have specifically chosen fonts, colors and sizes, for all 
                elements in the document. For the body text I have selected 'Times New Roman' as an option. To maintain a style I have 
                mainly used dark pink shades like `rgb(168, 0 70)` for headings and paragraphs backgrounds. To ensure contrast 
                and readability I have set the text color to 'whitesmoke.' Additionally elements like `h1` `h2` `h3` `p.one` 
                and `p.two` are given a box shadow effect of ` 5px 5px 5px black` creating an overall uniform design in the document.
                Another aleration I made was changing the font sizes of the headders to large It is essential to ensure that these design 
                choices align with the documents purpose and theme while considering accessibility and readability due, to the use of 
                background colors and text.
